### **Password Test Analysis**  
1. **Scores & Feedback**  
   - `password`: Cracked instantly (Weak)  
   - `Admin`: **0.06 seconds** (Very Weak)  
   - `Admin@12`: No time given (likely seconds/minutes)  
   - `Kaimur@07`: **17 years** (Very Strong)  
   - `Z9iqR7Sv`: **4,443 years** (Very Strong)  

2. **Best Practices Identified**  
   - **Length > Complexity**: `Z9iqR7Sv` (8 chars, random) is stronger than `Kaimur@07` (9 chars, partial dictionary).  
   - **Mix Character Types**: Use upper/lower case, numbers, **and symbols** (e.g., `@`).  
   - **Avoid Predictable Tricks**: Replacing `e` with `3` or `a` with `4` is easily cracked.  
   - **No Dictionary Words**: `Admin` and `password` fail instantly.  

3. **Tips Learned**  
   - Randomness is critical (e.g., `Z9iqR7Sv` vs. `Admin@12`).  
   - Longer passwords exponentially increase security (e.g., 8+ chars).  
   - Human-readable patterns (`Admin@12`) reduce strength.  

4. **Common Password Attacks**  
   - **Brute Force**: Tries all character combinations.  
   - **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common words/phrases (e.g., `password`, `Admin`).  

5. **Password Complexity vs. Security**  
   - **Length** is the top factor: Doubling length increases crack time exponentially.  
   - **Character diversity** (symbols/numbers) thwarts dictionary attacks but is ineffective if the base is predictable.
